## Web Clipper

As Obsidian Web Clipper will make new pages (like [[CIISec Cyber Extended Project Qualification]] ) which contain their source info and space to tag take notes do summaries etc. surely it makes sense to pick up links to things inside clipper and convert them into citations based on the info in clipping pointed at.  

## Extension ideas
Is it possible to render [[YakikimObsidian-11ty Collection of code from 11ty projects code that can be used for publishing Obsidian]] type links that are in the Clippings (or a setting) folder(s) (maybe other books) are converted to links which visually are in Harvard (or setting) style.

Other approach would be an "Insert a Citation" from other page which uses the data but builds a citation that obsidian can use.  

Or offer a convert to citation (Like the Reference Generator   [[https://github.com/kadisonm/obsidian-reference-generator]] )

### Bibtex Manager Extension

Also add a template in the settings for  "Bibtex Manager Extension" which follows the same pattern as Clipper which would allow us to add academic references to journals and books.


### Obsidian Book Search Plugin
