MFA is essential?!?!
But not easy for SMEs

Internally Microsoft will go full 2FA next summer (weird they aren't there yet)

Don't audit , talk


## AI Suppliers
Internal ai fairly safe
But if people are using OpenAI etc are they really in control 

What is sbond data (us software supply chain rules)



ICO say. Supply chain compromises quite common and getting around from there
ICO very much focused on safeguarding the individual not companies. Talking to ICO will reduce any fines 

Exercising with supply chains


One thing 
- MFA
- patching (foundational not basic)
- talk to your suppliers and peers
