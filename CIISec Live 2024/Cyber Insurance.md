# Cyber Insurance 
Currently insane tick box 
Brokers will try to sell you everything 
They sell by threat ( social engineering, ransomware etc  )


Exercising with CFOs can get you financial cost and insure to that.
Cyber insurance is Financing risk. And experice for the crisis management (Latvia has an ICO which needs a Latvian lawyer do you have one. The big insurers do).
