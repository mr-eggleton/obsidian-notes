### Publishing the papers. 
This year I've had as a theme that EPQ is an academic inquiry which is about building new knowledge by building on existing knowledge and possibly generating new information and analysing that as well.
If they have made new knowledge then surely other people should be able to build off that as well. 
I think that maybe you only do it for ones that were excellent and that you have good anti plagiarism checks in place. And that it's with permission and possibly anonymous (but is the something like an author claim certificate ?)

Personally I found the event extremely useful and interesting, and some of these might not be feasible for the event in its current form, but off the top of my head these are some ideas that could be amazing for future events especially if they were more geared towards students or at least had more students involved.

- A panel for students to ask questions about things like what companies are looking for when hiring, what skills or experience they require, and so on.
- More talks at a more introductory level that don't assume large amounts of industry knowledge to begin with
- Advice about sites to use to improve (overthewire.org, tryhackme, immersive labs and many more)
- Different schemes out there such as the cyberfirst bursary that students can take advantage of but may not be aware of
- Experts talking about their jobs roles and day-to-day to help students get an idea of what said role actually involves

  

  

  

Let me know if you have any questions or want to have a proper conversation about it at some point.
