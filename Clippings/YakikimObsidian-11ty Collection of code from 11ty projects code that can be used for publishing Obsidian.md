## Obsidian-11ty

[Demo](https://obsidian-11ty.netlify.app/) site.

This project has created as a platform for publishing selected posts/notes of your [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault using the front-meter data. It uses the beautiful [Eleventy, as static site generator platform](https://www.11ty.dev/).

The main features that makes the Obsidian so cool and implemented here, are:

- Turn Wikilinks `[[links]]` as well as MDLinks `[links](links.md)` into HTML links
- Images display with custom width
- Mermaid.js charts
- Backlinks
- Search option and etc.

### Project Description

Using this repository you will be able to:

1. (optional) Easily start using Obsidian with my pre-configured Obsidian's vault.
2. Backup your Obsidian vault using Github as private repository.
3. Define the publishing rules of your Obsidian vault
4. CI/CD your publishing vault(or the public part of it) using Netlify/Github.io
5. Custom build and deploy your blog (or the public part of it) using Docker container as your web server.
